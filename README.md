# Welcome
Welcome to the mandelbrot Operating System. 
This OS is built by a humble group of teenagers over at [Discord](https://discord.gg/W523cD3Q3P). 
We do this solely to have fun and to learn. 
We are not organized and are here to enjoy ourselves. 
Sounds appealing? Create a pull request!

# About 
This project is made for fun and learning.
It's like tracing OS history, but with modern knowledge and without a lot of budget lol

# Where are we in the project
**In that section, I will compare our OS to other OSes from the past**
**We are not saying that our OS is equal to them, (yet) we are way less talented than those guys were**
- We have a shell, with some commands.
- We are developing an equivalent to Unix / MS-DOS.
- We need a filesystem. We are planning to use USTAR.

# Build Requirements (Arch/Manjaro package names)
- `build-essential`
- `qemu`
- `nasm`
- `xorriso`
- `mtools`

# Running
You'll need to have a cross-compiler, build one using `./build-cross-compiler.sh`.
Run `make qemu` to compile the OS and run it in `qemu` (needs `qemu-system-i386`) or just `make` to compile it.
Build-time options are following:
- To build with azerty keyboard, add `AZERTY=1` to the command (`make AZERTY=1 qemu` for example).
- To build with clang instead of GCC, add `LLVM=1` to the command (`make LLVM=1 qemu` for example).

# Using
Using our OS is really simple, on boot, you'll be greeted with a shell.
<br>A small variety of commands are available:
- `cls` : clears the screen
- `hello` : prints `Hello World!`
- `hi` : prints `hi` 20 times
- `echo` : repeat any args
- `sysfetch` : neofetch but it's in the kernel
- `reboot` : reboot the system
- `bsod` : kernel panic the system
- `mandelbrot` : show mandelbrot background
- `ctheme` : change the theme with the following
  - legacy :

  - dark :

  - light :

## Using code
This is an open source project. Reuse code. Just follow the license terms and we are good. :)
